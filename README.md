# Uber-Data-Analysis

As we know uber is one of the fastest growing online car/auto service in India.Through our project I aim to provide a complete data analysis and predictive analysis for the uber company on how it can harness data to increase it's sales. 
So basically the project is divided into 4 parts :
1.Data preprocessing
2.Feature Engineering 
3.Exploratory Data analysis
4.Predictive analysis 
I have  implemented predictive analysis liKe clustering that might help the uber company to increase it's sales by placing more cabs in strategic locations.I  have also implemented a fare prediction model that might help the user to get an approximate idea of the fare of the ride.Apart from this I have provided an end to end data analysis through which the company could get an insight about the various trips ,days having highest no. of trips , variation of trips with years etc.
